                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>The term "shepherd" is used throughout the Bible in both its noun and verb forms, and can refer to literal shepherding of sheep or as a metaphor of God's unique relationship to His people. This second reference is specifically what is in view of 1 Peter 5:1-4. Through a short survey of some key verses spanning from Genesis all the way to Revelation, we will see that Peter's exhortation to the elders of the early church is rooted directly in the example of how God Himself shepherds his people.</p>

                    <h3>God as Our Good Shepherd</h3>
                    <p>To understand what it means for God to be our good shepherd, we turn to Psalm 23 and Isaiah 40:11. In Psalm 23, David tells us that God leads us in peace and righteousness (Ps 23:2-3), protects us (Ps 23:4), and provides for us (Ps 23:5) all for God's namesake (Ps 23:3). Similarly, a single verse Isaiah explains God's shepherding activity as protection, gathering, carrying, and gently leading His flock (Isa 40:11). If these are the descriptions that God's Word provides for how He shepherds His people, we can take these characteristics as the model for what a good shepherd should be for God's people.</p>

                    <h3>God Works Through Representatives</h3>
                    <p>While there are examples of God directly shepherding His people in the Bible (see Gen 48:15; 49:24), more commonly, God works through representatives to lead His people. It is explicitly stated in the Psalms that God "led [his] people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron" (Ps 77:20, CSB). Moses also directly appeals to God to "appoint a man over the community who will go out before them and come back in before them… so that the LORD's community won't be like sheep without a shepherd" (Num 27:16-17, CSB). It is worth noting that this plea from Moses comes after God reveals to Moses that he won't be entering the Promised Land due to his and Aaron's disobedience.</p>

                    <h3>The Failure of Israel's Shepherds</h3>
                    <p>If it isn't obvious from this insight, even a cursory skim through the Old Testament makes it abundantly clear that sinful humanity could never perfectly emulate the qualities of shepherding that God desires for His people. This is called out in length in Ezekiel 34. The prophet is told to prophesy against the shepherds of Israel in his day because they have greatly distorted God's intended purposes. These false shepherds have been serving themselves instead of the flock (Ezek 34:2) and neglecting their duties – to protect, provide for, gather up and deal gently with God's people (Ezek 34:4). Because of the failures of her leaders, Israel has "become prey" for her enemies ultimately leading to the Babylonian exile. However, even with these failures, God continues to raise up and use representatives to help lead His people, as we see in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>

                    <h3>Jesus: The Good Shepherd</h3>
                    <p>The penultimate example of the good shepherd that God desires is shown through the incarnate Jesus Christ. In that same chapter of Ezekiel 34 where God calls out the failures and wickedness of Israel's leaders, he also proclaims that He Himself will "rescue [His] flock from their mouths" (Ezek 34:10, CSB) and "shepherd them with justice" (Ezek 34:16, CSB), reiterating all the same provisions from Psalm 23 and Isaiah 40:11 highlighted earlier. With this backdrop, Jesus enters the picture. Throughout His ministry he exemplified all the qualities of the good shepherd by healing the sick, feeding thousands, and seeking the lost (see: Luke 15:1-7).</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most explicit treatment on this is captured in the gospel according to John. There Jesus directly states, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand, since he is not the shepherd and doesn't own the sheep, leaves them and runs away when he sees a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches and scatters them" (Jn 10:11-12, CSB). There is a compelling case to be made that Jesus here is alluding to the same failed leaders of Israel mentioned in Ezek 34 by mentioning the hired hands and contrasting them with Himself. If we want to understand the right ways to shepherd God's people, there can be no better example than Jesus.</p>

                    <h3>Jesus Raises Up Shepherds</h3>
                    <p>Continuing the same model as set forth through Moses and Joshua in the Old Testament, Jesus likewise established leaders to help guide His people in the new covenant era. Prophesied through Zechariah (Zech 13:7-9) and later quoted by Jesus talking about His coming crucifixion (Mk 14:27), the good shepherd would be struck down causing His sheep to be scattered. Because of this foretold event, Jesus knew to raise up shepherds that could guide his flock in His stead and through the Holy Spirit until He would return.</p>

                    <p>It's in this context that we turn to the commissioning of the 12 disciples. While traveling and preaching to many, Jesus "saw the crowds, [and] felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd" (Mt 9:36, CSB). It is directly after this that he sends out his disciples to "go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Mt 10:6, CSB) with instructions guiding them to model His kind of godly shepherding. That is, healing the sick and freely giving, without monetary compensation.</p>

                    <h3>Peter's Exhortation to Church Elders</h3>
                    <p>It is with this that we now analyze the exhortation to the early church elders by one of these shepherds that Jesus nurtured and raised up personally to guide his flock. There are three key points from the text of 1 Peter 5:1-4 that build upon the aforementioned context.</p>

                    <p>First, Peter roots the exhortation in the sufferings of Christ and the coming prophesied glory of Christ's kingdom (1 Pet 5:1; see Ezek 37:24-25). This is further highlighted when we realize this section also ends with the eschatological "unfading crown of glory" (1 Pet 5:4) as the bookend. If we are to lead well, we must have Christ and His future victory at the forefront of our minds.</p>

                    <p>Second, he compels proper motivations for leading and calling out negative incentives reminiscent of those mentioned in Ezekiel 34 – "Shepherd God's flock among you, not overseeing out of compulsion but willingly, as God would have you; not out of greed for money but eagerly; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock" (1 Pet 5:2-3, CSB). This is a direct warning to not be like the failed leaders of Israel that led to exile, and this requires us to constantly guard ourselves from world temptations.</p>

                    <p>Third, there isn't much practical advice given. Peter simply says to be "examples to the flock" (1 Pet 5:3, CSB). Yet, this is all encompassing if we first realize that Jesus, the "chief Shepherd" (1 Pet 5:4, CSB), is our example, and thus the standard we should strive for when we ourselves attempt to set an example for others. Moreover, we should really be pointing God's people back to Jesus instead of highlighting ourselves, although it is critical that we do emulate Jesus to the best of our ability to avoid being a stumbling block for the lost sheep.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>In summary, if we wish to truly shepherd God's flock as he intends, we must look to the examples God Himself has provided to us, always striving to be more like Jesus. God is the only true Good Shepherd for His people, but He desires to use us in His purposes, so to that end we must strive to be faithful servants and good shepherds ourselves.</p>
